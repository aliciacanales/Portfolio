The purpose of this project was to calculate the relative growth rates of Western Snowy Plovers at different locations across California. The next step was the use of the package GLARMA to see how impactful El Nino years will have on future Snowy Plover abundance. To run this project the user will need to run the scripts in chronological order.

## The order to run the scripts for the Snowy Plover Project:

1.data_wrangling.R
2.growth_rate_fcn.R
3.beach_growth_rates.R
4.glarma_analysis.R
5.visualizations.R (optional)
